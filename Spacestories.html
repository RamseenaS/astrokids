            <h2>The First Moon Landing 🌕</h2>
            <p>On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first human to step on the Moon. He famously said, <i>"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."</i></p>
            <p class="hidden-story">The Apollo 11 mission was a historic event that proved humans could travel beyond Earth. The astronauts collected lunar samples and conducted experiments, marking a new era of space exploration.</p>

            <h2>The Mysterious "Wow!" Signal 🛸</h2>
            <p>In 1977, astronomer Jerry Ehman discovered a strange radio signal from space. It lasted for 72 seconds and has never been detected again.</p>
            <p class="hidden-story">Many believe it was a signal from an alien civilization, while others argue it was a natural space phenomenon. To this day, the source remains a mystery.</p>

            <h2>The Face on Mars 😲</h2>
            <p>In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 orbiter captured an image of what looked like a human face on Mars.</p>
            <p class="hidden-story">Scientists later revealed that it was just a rock formation, but conspiracy theories about aliens on Mars continue to this day.</p>

            <h2>The Coldest Place in the Universe ❄️</h2>
            <p>A cloud of gas in the Boomerang Nebula is -457.7°F (-272°C), making it the coldest known natural place in the universe.</p>
            <p class="hidden-story">This temperature is just 1 degree above absolute zero, where atoms almost completely stop moving!</p>

            <h2>Saturn’s Moon Titan Has Rivers and Lakes! 🌊</h2>
            <p>Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, has rivers, lakes, and even rain—but they are made of liquid methane and ethane instead of water.</p>
            <p class="hidden-story">This makes Titan one of the most Earth-like places in the solar system, but way too cold for humans to survive.</p>

            <p class="hidden-story">Scientists still don’t fully understand why Neptune’s winds are so strong, but they make it the most extreme weather planet in our solar system.</p>
